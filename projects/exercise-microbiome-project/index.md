# Research project description
The aim of this research project is to track changes in the human gut microbiome (the trillions of microorganisms living in the human gut) that happen when you perform physical activity. We are interested in determining whether an increase in exercise can cause change in the human gut microbiome. The research team will study the link between changes in physical activity and the gut microbiome and will provide initial data for investigation into the possible causes of change to the healthy human gut microbiome over time. The resulting information will be helpful for investigating how physical exercise is linked with change over time in the gut microbe. These results may help us understand how changes in weight and fitness relate to changes in the gut microbiome. Additionally, these data may be useful for developing microbiome-based treatments for disease, weight gain or weight loss.
