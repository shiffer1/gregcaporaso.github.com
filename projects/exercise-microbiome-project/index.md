# Project description
The aim of this project is to track changes in the composition of the human gut microbiome (the trillions of microorganisms that live within the human gut) that happen in conjunction with prescribed changes in physical activity. We are interested in determining whether increase in human physical activity can cause variation in the human gut microbiome. The cohort developed as a part of this study will address the correlation between changes in physical activity and microbiome composition and will provide pilot data for investigation into the possible causes of changes in the healthy human gut microbiome over time. These data will be helpful in investigating the effects of physical exercise and different dietary assessments correlated with temporal variability in the gut microbe composition and results may help understand how changes in weight and fitness correlate with changes in the microbiome. Additionally, these data may be informative for developing microbiome-based treatments of disease or treatments for weight gain or loss (for example, by identifying organisms that should be included in probiotics).
