	I am a master's in biology at Northern Arizona University. I am studying the microbiome of the surgeonfish gastrointestinal tract. 
### Current Projects:

 Surgeonfish are a group of tropical fish that are known hosts of Epulopiscium fishelsoni. E.fishelsoni is in the phylum Firmicutes and is the largest bacteria yet discovered, being approximately 600 um in length and 800 um in diameter.
 My project aims to characterize the abundance of E. fishelsoni and characterize the microbial ecology of the surgeonfish gastrointestinal tract.
