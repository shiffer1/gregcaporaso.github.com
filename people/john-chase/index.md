# What I do

I am currently working on a microbial ecology project titled *Longitudinal and  Spatial Characterization of Microbial Communities in Offices*. This project has taken samples from three offices in each city of Flagstaff, San Diego and Toronto. Currently sample collection is completed and I am in the analysis stage of the project.
I am currently analyzing the data and attempting to apply new statistical techniques not commonly used in microbial ecology such as generalized linear models. I am also involved in developing <a href='http://scikit-bio.org/' target='_blank'>scikit-bio</a> and <a href='http://qiime.org/' target='_blank'>QIIME</a>.

# My Interests
I am interested in nearly all aspects of genetic analysis, though my focus is primarily in microbial ecology. One of my main goals in the field of genetics is discovering new ways of analyzing information that will directly benefit the quality of life of humans. I believe that our personal genetics and microbiomes are intrinsically related. Drawing conclusions from these two types of data is both a biological and data analysis problem which are two topics I greatly enjoy. Additionally I am interested in developing software tools that facilitate these types of analyses.
