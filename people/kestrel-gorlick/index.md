#A Little About Me

I am a Junior at BASIS Flagstaff. My scholastic interests are focused mainly on computer science and general programming. I've programmed in Python for 3 years, and plan to learn Java and take the AP Computer Science AB next year. I also plan on enrolling at NAU and majoring in computer science to get my bachelors degree. Hopefully after that, I will be able to enroll at MIT for my masters. I've always loved computer science, and hope to work and contribute on a larger scale in that field.
