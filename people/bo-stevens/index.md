  I am a Masters student in Biology at NAU. I am interested in bioinformatics,
  ecology, remote sensing, microbiology, and the public perception of complex
  and novel scientific issues. For my thesis, I am working with the Nancy
  Johnson Lab to elicit patterns of bacterial and fungal communities within the
  Serengeti grasslands. In addition, I am conducting an analysis of the
  presence of bias among published literature on the topic of genetic
  modification.

#What I do
My primary focus is the data analysis of various projects in the [Nancy Johnson Lab of Eoil Ecology](http://nau.edu/CEFNS/NATSCI/SESES/Research/Labs-Collections/Soil-Ecology/). Primarily, I work with [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/), [QIIME](http://qiime.org/), and python. I also have experience with remote sensing and GIS, which I use to create various maps that the lab uses for publications and presentations.
#What I’m interested in
Ecoinformatics and big data analysis are essential tools that are being used to answer questions about how an ecosystem functions. I am interested in acquiring and improving the skills necessary for this sort of data analysis. Hence, my education is focused on programming in R and python, statistics, biology, and ecology. Most interesting to me is ecology and its challenging complexity and enormous potential for new discoveries. 
In addition, I’m passionate about transgenic modification and how it will be applied  to ecosystem management. Recent advances in bacterial genome recoding ([Mandell et al. 2015](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7537/full/nature14121.html)) have demonstrated that containment is possible. This will most likely assuage concerns of novel, modified bacteria escaping into an ecosystem and becoming unmanageably invasive. Soon, flexible applications of highly controllable modified bacteria could be added to depleted soil to restore health. Novel bacteria could improve agricultural production, mitigate climate change impacts, bio remediate polluted soil, or restore damaged ecosystems. We live in exciting times.
