# About me

I'm still fairly new to the wonderful world of bioinformatics. My background
is in software engineering, primarily in avionics and telecom. A while back
I took some time to seriously contemplate what I want my career to be about.
I decided to find a way to apply my passion for computing to
medical research. This eventually led me to bioinformatics, and I haven't
looked back. Bioinformatics is this awesome blend of computer science, 
biology, and statistics, all of which I love. There are tons of
interesting problems to be solved. I'm learning a lot working with
the awesome team here at the lab. I'm currently finishing an undergraduate degree
in computer engineering. My plan is to continue on to grad school, either
in computer science or directly in bioinformatics. My ultimate goal is
to work with bioinformatics in cancer research.

# My software philosophies

I believe in practicing data driven engineering. I think that decisions about
sofware design and implementation should be made based on actual data
whenever possible. I try to avoid any guesswork or assumptions.
I'm a big fan of test driven development, profiling, and
clean, high performance code. I also love data visualization, functional
programming, parallel computing, real time programming, embedded systems,
single board computers, and FPGAs. I really enjoy
experimenting with new programming languages. My current focus in this
regard is using [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) to solve bioinformatics
problems on [rosalind](http://rosalind.info/).
