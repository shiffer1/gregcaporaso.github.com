My PhD dissertation research in the UC San Diego/San Diego State University
joint doctoral program combined bioinformatics methods and molecular biology
to study oral polymicrobial communities and impact on human health. As a
postdoctoral scholar in the Caporaso Lab, I am working on the impact of
probiotics on the human gut microbiome in individuals with Autism Spectrum
Disorders. In addition, I am working on benchmarking some of the standard
approaches for analyzing metagenomic data.

I am interested in human microbiome studies in particular, but enjoy other aspects of microbiology and data analysis as well.

Postdoctoral scholar, Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics.
