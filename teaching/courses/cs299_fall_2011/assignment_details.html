<h2>Programming assignment 3: Assembling an overlap table<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-assignment-3-assembling-an-overlap-table" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this assignment you will assemble an overlap table that could be used in the de novo assembly of a genome from a set of short sequencing reads.</p>
<p>Create a new python file named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prog3_&lt;userid&gt;.py</span></tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">userid</span></tt> is replaced with your NAU user id. You must also define <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">userid=&lt;userid&gt;</span></tt> (again where &lt;userid&gt; is replaced with your NAU user id) in your script so that it can be imported into other code. Any deviations from these instructions <strong>will result in a zero on this assignment</strong>!</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>In this file, define a function that takes a list of (sequence id, sequence) tuples and a substitution matrix. This function should return:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">overlap_matrix</span></tt>: a 2D list where each internal list <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></tt>  represents a vector of the number of overlapping positions between sequence <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i</span></tt> and every sequence in the input sequence collection;</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repeat_counts</span></tt>: a list containing the number of times each sequence is repeated in its entirety.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The overlap score should be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-1</span></tt> for the overlap between a sequence and itself or any other identical repeat. (For identical repeat I use the definition of python string equality, so if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">b</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></tt> is an identical repeat of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">b</span></tt> and vice versa.)</p>
<p>The function should be of the form:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">compute_overlaps</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">seqs</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">substitution_matrix</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">overlap_matrix</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">repeat_counts</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should additionally define a 2D dictionary <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">assembly_substitution_matrix</span></tt> that contains scores for substitutions between the nucleotide bases. You will define the values in this martix to optimize them for this task.</p>
<p>Additionally, I want you to benchmark your script against several large collections of sequences, and plot the run time of each. You can get the run time by using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">time</span></tt> command which is built-in to Unix/Linux and Mac OS X. If you are running Windows on your laptop you can either do this portion on the Amazon Cloud or in the Computer Science lab in the engineering building. It may be useful for you to generate a command line interface for your script to achieve this portion of the assignment. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MinimalFastaParser</span></tt> function in PyCogent will additionally be useful here: given an open fasta file, this returns a list (really a generator) of (sequence_id, sequence) tuples, which is the input expected by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">compute_overlaps</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Download the files here for your benchmark analysis <tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">here</span></tt> For this component of the assignment, I want you to turn in a scatter plot where the x axis is the number of sequences in the input file and the y axis is the runtime of your script in seconds.</p>

<h2>Programming assignment 2: Constructing a phylogenetic tree<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-assignment-2-constructing-a-phylogenetic-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this assignment you will make use of the PyCogent software package to automate the process of constructing a phylogenetic tree from a set of genes.</p>
<p>Create a new python file named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prog2_&lt;userid&gt;.py</span></tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">userid</span></tt> is replaced with your NAU user id.

<p>In this file, define a function that takes a list of queries to be run against NCBI and a list of query labels to label the results of each query in the final tree, and returns a phylogenetic tree derived from aligned representatives of those queries.

<h2>Modified exercise 38<a class="headerlink" href="#modified-exercise-38" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For LPTHW modified exercise 38 I want you to find and review bioinformatics code (rather than some random code out on the internet).</p>
<p>For folks who are already comfortable with Python, start with PyCogent, QIIME, or any other bioinformatics python code you come across. Start <a class="reference external" href="http://pycogent.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pycogent/trunk/cogent/">here for PyCogent</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://qiime.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qiime/trunk/qiime/">here for QIIME</a> (after clicking on a file name, click the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">View</span></tt> link under <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Links</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">HEAD</span></tt>). Record in your programming notebook which file(s) you work with.</p>
<p>For students who are just learning python, review in detail the sequence evolution script that we built in Lecture 8. Work through this until you can explain what <cite>each line</cite> is doing. Ideally work with a friend and explain the lines to each other. Then make some modifications to change the behavior. You can find that <a class="reference internal" href="lectures/lecture8.html#sequence-evolution-script"><em>here</em></a>.</p>

<h2>BLASTing Through the Kingdom of Life<a class="headerlink" href="#blasting-through-the-kingdom-of-life" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>This assignment will be due in class on Tuesday Sept 27th. This is a graded homework assignment that must be turned in on paper (i.e., not digitally). Your answers must be typed, not hand-written, and formatted as in the example answers in</strong> <a class="reference download internal" href="../../_downloads/BTTKOL_students.pdf"><tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">document</span></tt></a> <strong>. Your name must appear at the top left of the first page.</strong> I will deduct points for deviations from these requirements.</p>
<p>In class on Tuesday Sept 20th I&#8217;ll give out assignments of which students will work with which two sequences. Everyone should work independently on this project: it&#8217;s OK to talk with other students about the project, but <strong>it is not OK look at each others results</strong>.</p>
<p>This assignment will go faster if you start by reviewing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitalworldbiology.com/BLAST/index.html">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>You can find your sequences <a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitalworldbiology.com/BLAST/62000sequences.html">here</a> and the list of assigned sequences <a class="reference download internal" href="../../_downloads/BLASTing_assignments.txt"><tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">here</span></tt></a> .</p>
<p>You should answer the questions posted <a class="reference download internal" href="../../_downloads/BTTKOL_students.pdf"><tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">here</span></tt></a> for each of your two sequences. Note that there are sample answers for an example sequence - you should format your answers as you see in the sample answers in this PDF (don&#8217;t forget the <cite>Information Source</cite>!).</p>

<h2>Modified Exercise 36: Adding error checking to our sequence processing script<a class="headerlink" href="#modified-exercise-36-adding-error-checking-to-our-sequence-processing-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Read through Exercise 36, but don&#8217;t do the <cite>Homework</cite> section. Instead, do the following.</p>
<p>Start with the example script from lecture 5 (<a class="reference internal" href="lectures/lecture5.html#sequence-processing-script"><em>see here</em></a>: use the last one included in lecture 5 with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reverse_complement</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">transcribe</span></tt> functions.)</p>
<p>We discussed several times that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reverse_complement</span></tt> function as implemented is wrong. Use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop to improve this: this script should print an error message to the terminal and exit without writing the output file if the input sequence contains any characters other than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">G</span></tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">T</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Advanced python users: try reimplementing this function with a dictionary and with string&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">translate</span></tt> method. Which implementation is most efficient if you try to process a lot (e.g., 100) very large strings (e.g., length 1,000,000)? Back up your answer with data (hint: check out the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">time</span></tt> command) and log your results in your programming notebook. Check out the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">choice</span></tt> method in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">random</span></tt> module - use this with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop to generate your string. Can you come up with any more efficient mechanisms for reverse complementing a string (I don&#8217;t have a specific example in mind here...)? What are some reasons why you might choose one implementation over another?</p>
<p>Log your modified script in your programming notebook by pasting the code in.</p>
<p><strong>E-mail me your programming notebook before class begins on Tuesday!</strong></p>

<h2>Programming noteboook (on-going; will be collected several times through-out the semester)<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-noteboook-on-going-will-be-collected-several-times-through-out-the-semester" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The programming notebook is an electronic journal to keep track of your progress with learning python. The things that I&#8217;m looking for are notes on what you had difficulties with, what you had to look up along the way, and how you solved certain problems. As you move through the exercises you&#8217;ll undoubtedly run into the same issues again - if you have a record of how you previously solved a problem, looking back through this journal should help you. You are also expected to answer any <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Extra</span> <span class="pre">Credit</span></tt> questions that are raised in the LPTHW text in your programming notebook. I don&#8217;t, however, need to see all of the code snippets that you write for the exercises here.</p>
<p>I recommend that you keep notes in whatever program you&#8217;re comfortable with, provided that when I collect these you&#8217;ll be able to generate a PDF that you can send to me. Some choices might be MS Word, Google Docs, Evernote, Gedit (you&#8217;ll need to print to PDF), etc.</p>
<p>A few (random) times through-out the semester I&#8217;ll collect your programming notebooks in electronic form. I&#8217;ll review these and score them on completeness.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what your notebook might look like for the first three exercises:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Exercise 0 (31 Aug 2011)

Installed Gedit and created a test file. Had to look up how to make and
change directories on the web. I googled &quot;how to make a directory in the
Terminal&quot; and found this page: http://guides.macrumors.com/Terminal. This
pages covers some useful commands for working the in terminal - I found
mkdir and cd here.

Exercise 1

This exercise was easy. Ran into one issue where I got a syntax error
because I used a double-quote to start a string and a single-quote to
end a string. Easy fix once I figured out the problem.

Extra credits: 1) Just added another print statement; 2) Deleted all of
the lines except for one; 3) The &#39;#&#39; symbol causes a line not to be
interpreted - if you add this to the line everything after the # is ignored.
I figured this out by experimenting with putting # signs in my code and
rerunning it. This would have been a better way to achieve the result of
exercise (2).

Exercise 2 (1 Sept 2011)

No problems with writing or running the code.

Extra credits: 1) Yep, I was right about what the &#39;#&#39; symbol does. 3) Missed a
space between print and &quot;This will run.&quot; on line 9 when re-entering the code. This
caused a syntax error.
