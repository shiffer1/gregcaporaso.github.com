<p class="last">I encourage you to discuss homework assignments with each other, but you may not view other student&#8217;s assignments or share your assignment with others. When you start programming, you often think there is a single way to address a task, but that is usually not the case: there are many ways to complete these assignments, and when code has been shared or copied it is often very obvious to a more experienced eye.</p>

<p>For the remaining assignments this semester we&#8217;ll use an Amazon Cloud based cluster. You should have received a key file (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;nau-id&gt;.rsa</span></tt>) and ip address by email. (I won&#8217;t post the ip address here for security reasons.) Use the key file and the ip address to connect as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ssh -i &lt;key-file&gt; &lt;nau-id&gt;@&lt;ip-address&gt;

<p class="last">Start Early! The QIIME DB uses a shared server for this analysis, and you never know how busy it will be.</p>
</div>
<p>For this assignment you will perform a meta-analysis of several microbial surveys of the indoor environment. To get more details on microbiology of the built environment, check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microbe.net/">microBEnet</a>. You will use the QIIME Database to perform this meta-analysis - you&#8217;ll export several initial results from the QIIME DB, including a combined OTU table, and taxonomy survey and beta diversity results. You&#8217;ll download these data either to the class cluster or your own computer to perform some more in-depth analyses.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to perform the QIIME meta-analysis:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create an account with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microbio.me/qiime">QIIME Database</a>.</li>
<li>On logging in, choose &#8216;Create a New Meta-Analysis&#8217;. Name your meta-analysis and hit &#8216;Next&#8217;. Click &#8216;Perform Meta-analysis&#8217;</li>
<li>Next, you&#8217;ll choose the studies you want to include. Choose <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Kelley_office_contamination</span></tt> (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0037849">cite</a>), <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Flores_restroom_surface_biogeography</span></tt> (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028132">cite</a>), and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime</span></tt> (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/suppl.1/4516.long">cite</a>). Then do the following: uncheck &#8220;Show Common Fields Only&#8221;; Select Metadata Fields: &#8220;All&#8221;; Hit &#8216;&gt;&gt;&#8217; to copy all metadata fields to your mapping file; Hit &#8220;Continue&#8221;.</li>
<li>Select &#8220;Processing Method: Serial&#8221;; Check &#8220;Taxonomy Summary&#8221;&#8221;, then expand &#8220;Optional parameters (sort_otu_table.py), and set &#8220;Category to sory by&#8221; to STUDY_TITLE; Check &#8220;Beta-Diversity&#8221;, expand &#8220;Optional Parameters (rarefaction.py), and set &#8220;Rarified at&#8221; to 500 seqs/sample, then expand &#8220;Optional Parameters (beta_diversity.py), and set &#8220;Metrics to use&#8221; to bray_curtis, weighted_unifrac, unweighted_unifrac, euclidean; choose 3d PCOA plots (no optional parameters). Click &#8220;Submit&#8221;.</li>
<li>This may take a while to run. When it&#8217;s done, you can begin to explore the results via the database website. Download the &#8220;Zip Archive&#8221; to address the questions below.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will turn in a maximum of a three page paper describing your analysis, including a brief introduction (describe what specific types of samples are under investigation here as well as some background on the studies the samples were derived from), description of your methods, and description of your results. Focus your results on the following questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Do the four distance metrics you applied result in similar PCoA plots? Compare these visually, and present a distance matrix of Procrustes M^2 values between the four principal coordinate matrices generated by the QIIME DB (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*_pc.txt</span></tt>) as a table in your paper and discuss your conclusions from this analysis. This will involve running a bunch of commands, reviewing the output of each, and using that output to compile a 4x4 distance matrix (e.g., in Excel).</li>
<li>What does the clustering pattern in your weighted UniFrac PCoA plot tell you about the likely sources of the indoor microbial communities from the different studies (as judged by the similarity of the indoor communities to the diverse set of samples in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CaporasoIlluminaPNAS2011_5prime</span></tt> study)? Include the most informative view of your PCoA, with a color legend, in your paper to support this analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>On an additional page (in addition to your three page paper) please provide feedback on the following questions on the usability of the QIIME database. (This is absolutely required! The QIIME DB is in beta testing status right now, and in exchange for getting to use it for this project to expose you to new tools, I agreed to require you to provide input that is useful in testing of the system.)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Do you have any suggestions for QIIME DB user interface improvements?</li>
<li>Did you notice any issues with stability of the system (e.g., did anything crash or hang)?</li>
<li>Are there any additional features that would be useful?</li>
<li>Do you get all of the data that you wanted when downloading the zip archive, or are there additional files that should be provided?</li>
<li>Do you feel that you sufficiently understand the methods being applied (i.e., is relevant information being provided at the right times)?</li>

<h2>Final Project Option 2: Building a tree of life (programming assignment)<a class="headerlink" href="#final-project-option-2-building-a-tree-of-life-programming-assignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this assignment you will make use of the PyCogent software package to automate the process of constructing a phylogenetic tree from a set of genes. This will including querying NCBI to obtain sequences, performing a multiple sequence alignment, building a phylogenetic tree, writing a newick string containing that tree to file, and writing a visualization of that tree to a PDF file.</p>
<p>Your script must define a function called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">obtain_sequences_and_build_tree</span></tt> that takes:
1. a list of queries (as strings) to be run against NCBI;
2. a list of query labels (also as strings) to label the sequences resulting from each query in the final tree;
3. the filepath where the output newick string should be written;
4. the filepath where the output pdf should be written;
5. an optional parameter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></tt> which defines how many randomly chosen query results should be chosen for each of the queries. The default value for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></tt> should be 5.</p>
<p>Your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">obtain_sequences_and_build_tree</span></tt> function must return a phylogenetic tree derived from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></tt> aligned representatives of each of the queries passed via parameter 1.

<p>As part of your analysis, you should filter any sequences that have one or more <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span></tt> characters in them. Each sequence label in the output tree should begin with the query label corresponding to that sequence. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tree</span></tt> should be a PyCogent <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PhyloNode</span></tt> object (the output of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cogent.app.fasttree.build_tree_from_alignment</span></tt>).</p>
<p>In your script, you should call the function you define as follows:</p>

<p>Write a program that makes use of a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop and a dictionary to translate an RNA sequence to a protein for all four orientations of the input sequence (forward, reverse, forward complement, reverse complement, where forward refers to the sequence that was passed in).

<p>Assume that you will only receive IUPAC RNA bases (either upper or lower case) as input. In other words, you don&#8217;t need to handle non-RNA characters in the input sequence.

<p class="last">This assignment is designed to force you to use existing resources (internet, primary literature) to learn to use an existing bioinformatics tool to address a biological question. Because of the amount that you&#8217;re expected to learn on your own, this homework will involve additional effort relative to the others so far this semester. <strong>It will be a lot easier</strong> if you begin by working through the <a class="reference external" href="http://qiime.org/svn_documentation/tutorials/illumina_overview_tutorial.html">Illumina Overview Tutorial</a>, followed by the <a class="reference external" href="http://qiime.org/svn_documentation/tutorials/tutorial.html">QIIME Overview Tutorial</a>.  There is no class on 16 October 2012: use that time to get started on this!</p>
</div>
<p>Begin by reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/14/6477.long">Fierer et al</a>. You will use QIIME to reproduce the analyses presented in this paper.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Data analysis: You will perform a complete QIIME analysis of the data set presented in Fierer et al, and turn in the following items:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>A 3 page (maximum!) paper describing your analysis. Write this as if you&#8217;re submitting to a journal, so should contain an <cite>Introduction</cite> section describing the hypotheses being addressed and the strategy for addressing these (refer to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/14/6477.long">Fierer et al</a>), a <cite>Methods</cite> section containing a brief description of your bioinformatics methods (e.g., what version of QIIME, what type of OTU picking was used) and how the data was generated (e.g., sequencing platform), and a <cite>Results</cite> section describing the results of your analysis. Your 2-3 pages should include a beta diversity PCoA plot (generated by <a class="reference external" href="http://qiime.org/scripts/beta_diversity_through_plots.html">beta_diversity_through_plots.py</a>; focus on Unweighted UniFrac, which is what we discussed in class) in a view that supports your conclusions, and an alpha rarefaction plot (generated by <a class="reference external" href="http://qiime.org/scripts/alpha_rarefaction.html">alpha_rarefaction.py</a>). You should also include a table that lists the five OTUs that are most significantly different across the <cite>Subject</cite> category in your mapping file (generated by <a class="reference external" href="http://qiime.org/scripts/otu_category_significance.html">otu_category_significance.py</a>). Figures and tables should take up no more than one total page of your paper. This paper must be turned in as a PDF - <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.doc</span></tt> or other word processing formats will not be accepted.</li>
<li>Evenly sampled OTU table (generated by <a class="reference external" href="http://qiime.org/scripts/beta_diversity_through_plots.html">beta_diversity_through_plots.py</a>). This should be provided as a gzipped <cite>.biom</cite> file.</li>
<li>Text file containing the full list of commands that you ran to generate the above data, noting any problems that you ran into along the way.</li>

<p>In this assignment you will automate retrieval and processing of PDB files with a shell (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bash</span></tt>) script, and turn that script in. We will run that script and grade you on the results. Your script should perform the following steps:</p>

<p>Perform the reformatting steps described below. You&#8217;ll turn in two metadata mapping files, one for the human-associated samples and one for all other samples (this splitting is one of the formatting steps described below). You&#8217;ll also turn in a <em>patterns file</em>, which will be a text file containing list of the search and replace patterns that were applied to perform the reformatting, including &#8220;comment&#8221; lines before each pair of patterns describing what the following pattern does. Comment lines <em>must</em> begin with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt> symbol so they can be computationally differentiated from non-comment lines.</p>
<p>Each line in your <em>patterns file</em> should contain exactly one regular expression pattern: for each task you should have the search pattern on one line, followed by the replace pattern on the next line. These patterns must work in either TextWrangler or jEdit (I don&#8217;t care which, but your patterns must work in one of the two).</p>

<li>Reformat <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RUN_DATE</span></tt> entries to contain full year (four digits rather than two)</li>
<li>Create two new fields from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PCR_PRIMERS</span></tt> field: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FWD_PCR_PRIMER</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REV_PCR_PRIMER</span></tt> where each field contains the primer nucleotide sequence only (ie., including only the IUPAC nucleotide characters).</li>
<li>Remove these columns: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EMP_PERSON</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR_CONTACT</span></tt></li>
